Pangolin establishes secure connections from edge networks to cloud exit nodes, bypassing the need for public inbound ports and complex firewall configurations. Pangolin is incredibly useful for exposing local services, IoT devices, or internal applications to the internet without direct exposure, enhancing security by reducing attack surface and simplifying network management. Additionally, Pangolin acts as an identity-aware proxy by authenticating every request against admin-defined access controls and rules.

## What is a fossorial animal?

The Pangolin system is made up of many components, all with unique animal names. These animals are called fossorial animals.

A fossorial animal is one adapted to digging which lives primarily but not solely, underground. Some examples are badgers, naked mole-rats, clams, meerkats, and mole salamanders, as well as many beetles, wasps, and bees.
