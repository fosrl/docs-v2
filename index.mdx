Pangolin is an open-source, identity-based remote access platform built on WireGuard that enables secure, seamless connectivity to private and public resources.

Pangolin combines reverse proxy and VPN capabilities into one platform. It provides browser-based access to web applications and client-based access to private resources like databases and SSH servers, all with zero-trust security and granular access control.

Pangolin connects remote networks using lightweight software connectors called sites. Sites create secure tunnels without requiring public IP addresses or open ports. Admins define specific resources that users can access, not entire networks. This gives users only the access they need while keeping everything else secure.

Users access public resources through any web browser with authentication. Users access private resources by connecting with a Pangolin client on their device. Both methods use the same identity-based access control, so you manage users and permissions in one place.

## What is a Fossorial Animal?

The Pangolin system is made up of many components, all with unique animal names. These animals are called fossorial animals.

A fossorial animal is one adapted to digging which lives primarily but not solely, underground. Some examples are badgers, naked mole-rats, clams, meerkats, newts, olms, and yes - of course - pangolins.
