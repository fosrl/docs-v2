## Blocking Devices

To block a device that has been compromised or lost:

1. Navigate to the device in your client list
2. Click the Action Menu (three dots)
3. Select **Block**

When you block a device, it is immediately moved to a restricted list and loses access to all resources or the ability to connect.

## Archiving Devices

Devices cannot be permanently deleted from Pangolin. Instead, you can archive devices to remove them from your active client list.

To archive a device:

1. Navigate to the device in your client list
2. Click the Action Menu (three dots)
3. Select **Archive**

### Why Archive Instead of Delete?

Pangolin maintains a permanent audit trail of all devices that have accessed your resources. This ensures:

- Block rules remain effective even for archived devices
- Security logs and access history are preserved

Archiving keeps your interface clean by hiding inactive or duplicate devices while maintaining the integrity of your security records.

## Filtering

You can filter your client list to show only active, blocked, or archived devices.
