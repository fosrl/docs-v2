description: "Create a client to connect to your Pangolin network from a remote computer"
---

A client is a way to access resources on sites remotely and privately via a virtual private network. Clients are used with private resources to faciliate zero-trust network access.

By default a client does not have access to any hosts on the local network of the site. Admins must explicitly define resources on the site and give specific users and roles access to the resources.

Users must log in and connect from a Pangolin client available on [Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS/iPadOS, and Android](/manage/clients/install-client). Machines (automated systems and servers) connect with an ID and secret.

## Client Types

There are two types of clients: user devices and machines.

  - Associated with a user in your Pangolin organization
  - Requires login to connect (password, 2fa, etc)
  - Available for download on Mac, Windows, and Linux

<Card title="Machines">
  - Represent a server or automated system instead of a user
  - Connect with an ID and secret
  - Available in CLI form with Pangolin CLI

### User Devices

A user may download a client for their specific system. Before they can connect, they must select a Pangolin server to authenticate to using their provided Pangolin account. Users can log in as a Pangolin user or with your attached external identity provider.

Examples include:

- **SSH**: Admins and developers can connect with their client to specific hosts for SSH.
- **RDP**: Users can connect to a remote host using familiar remote desktop software.

Then, just like in the Pangolin dashboard, a user selects the organization to connect to. Once connected, all resources made available to the user in that organization become available via the tunnel.

### Machines

Machine clients are for servers and automated systems that are not associated with a specific user.

Examples include:

- **CICD**: Access remote resources like a database in an automated deployment pipeline.
- **Servers**: Provide a VPS with access to a resource running in a different network.

Though you may connect a server via a user account using a CLI client, we recommend you specifically use a machine client.

Machine clients authenticate with an ID and secret string. These credentials are passed via arguments into one of the supported Pangolin CLI clients. They can be revoked and rotated.

## Client Modalities

Clients have two major operation modalities. A client will first attempt to hole punch before falling back to relaying.

### Relaying

Clients can relay traffic through a Pangolin server - through Gerbil specifically. Gerbil listens on UDP port 21820 for new WireGuard connections and forwards the packets down the Newt site tunnels to the right peers. This means your connections back to your site do not require firewall config and uses the existing NAT holepunching capabilities of Newt.

### NAT Hole Punching

NAT hole punching establishes a direct peer-to-peer connection between the client and site, bypassing the need to route traffic through the Pangolin server. The server coordinates the initial connection by helping both peers discover each other's network addresses, allowing them to establish a direct tunnel through their respective NATs and firewalls.

If the site and client are unable to hole punch, they fall back to relaying through your Pangolin server.

Take a look at [some things you can do to improve reliability](/manage/sites/configure-site#nat-traversal-tweaks) if you are not getting reliable hole punching.

This should help to:
- Increase performance (speed/bandwidth)
- Reduce VPS transit costs
