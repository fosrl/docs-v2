## Mac and Windows

### Automatic Updates (Recommended)

The desktop clients for Mac and Windows will periodically check for updates in the background. When an update is available, they will request permission to update. However, you can manually check for updates in the menu bar or system tray menu, or by restarting the application.

Once you accept the update, these clients will automatically download the latest version and replace itself on your computer.

### Manual Updates

- **Mac**: Find the latest version in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/fosrl/apple/releases).
- **Windows**: Find the latest version in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/fosrl/windows/releases).

You can download the latest installer files and restart the installation process to install the latest version. Visit [https://pangolin.net/downloads](https://pangolin.net/downloads) to find the latest official installers for your platform.

## Pangolin CLI

Find the latest version in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/fosrl/cli/releases).

### Automatic Updates (Recommended)

If you already have Pangolin CLI installed, use the update command:

```bash
pangolin update
```

Or you can re-run the installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://static.pangolin.net/get-cli.sh | bash
```

### Manual Updates

Download the latest binary for your system from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/fosrl/cli/releases) and replace your existing binary.

```bash
wget -O pangolin "https://github.com/fosrl/cli/releases/download/{version}/pangolin-cli_{architecture}" && chmod +x ./pangolin
```

<Note>
Replace `{version}` with the desired version and `{architecture}` with your architecture. Check the [release notes](https://github.com/fosrl/cli/releases) for the latest information.
