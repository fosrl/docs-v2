## Device Fingerprinting

Pangolin clients collect device fingerprinting information and can perform
security posture checks to help determine trusted devices. This information can
be used to enforce security policies, audit device configurations, or monitor
compliance with organizational requirements. Snapshots of device information are
collected periodically on each platform when clients are connected.

## Collected Fingerprint Information

The following device attributes are collected on each device when available:

- Username
- Hostname
- OS version
- Kernel version
- Architecture
- Device model
- Serial number

## Available Posture Checks

Posture checks are also collected on each platform; this is device state that
could potentially change, such as biometric availability, firewall settings, and
other related information if it is available.

Posture checks are supported on a per-platform basis.

### Windows

| Posture Check         | What It Reports                                                   |
