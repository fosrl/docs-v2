---

Pangolin can forward user identity information to your backend applications through custom HTTP headers. This allows your applications to receive user details directly from the request headers, enabling integration with Pangolin's authentication system.

<Info>
Forwarded headers are only available when using authentication methods that provide user identity information.

## Supported Headers

Pangolin forwards the following headers to your backend when user identity is available:

| Header | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `Remote-User` | Unique username or user ID | `user_123` |
| `Remote-Email` | User's email address | `john.doe@example.com` |
| `Remote-Name` | User's full name | `John Doe` |
