### Change Password

If you're already logged in, you can change your password by clicking your profile menu (top right) and selecting Change Password. You will be required to confirm your old password and enter a new password.

<Tip>
If you want to require password changes at regular intervals for better security, check out the [password rotation documentation](/manage/access-control/password-rotation).
</Tip>

### Reset Password

If you forgot your password, you can use the reset password function. On the login page, select Forgot your password?. This will ask for your username or email. A reset code will be sent to that email to complete the reset.

If you're self‑hosting Pangolin, you will need an SMTP server configured to send emails. If you don't have one configured, the server will log the reset code to the server logs for you to retrieve and use to reset the password.

### Force Reset Server Admin Password

For self‑hosted Pangolin, if you need to force reset your server admin account password server‑side, you can use the internal CLI. [See more here](/self-host/advanced/container-cli-tool).
