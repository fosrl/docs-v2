title: "Session Length"
description: "Configure maximum session length and expiration policies for your organization"

By default, Pangolin keeps extending a session indefinitely if a user is actively using it. If a user is not actively using the session, it will expire after 30 days.

However, you can require users to log in at regular intervals by enforcing maximum session lengths on a per‑organization basis.

### Configuration

<Note>
Session length enforcement is an Enterprise Edition only feature.
</Note>

To enable session length enforcement, go to Organization Settings and set a maximum session length in the Security section. After this amount of time, users will be prompted to log back in to acquire a fresh session.

- Session length enforcement is configured per organization.
- Session length enforcement applies to both internal Pangolin users and users linked to external identity providers.
- Users whose session has expired will see a prompt directing them to log in again before proceeding.
