Pangolin is multi-tenant. All sites, resources, clients, and other items belong to an organization, and a server can host more than one organization.

Each organization has a unique ID that Pangolin generates when you create the organization. You cannot change the ID after creation, and it is separate from the display name.

## Finding your organization ID

You can find your organization ID in two ways:

1. Check the general settings page for your organization. The ID appears at the top of the info card.

2. Check the URL path when viewing your dashboard. The org ID is the first slug in the URL. For example, in `https://app.pangolin.net/home-lab/settings/sites`, the org ID is `home-lab`.
