Aliases provide a secondary, user-friendly address for any of your Resources, allowing users to access the Resource using this alternate name in addition to the original address. 

For instance, a router with the address `10.0.0.1` could be assigned the alias `router.internal`, and users could connect using either. Aliases are accessible to anyone who has access to the Resource, and they are exclusively accessible when connected with a Pangolin client, meaning they function without requiring any external DNS record setup. Furthermore, aliases are protocol agnostic, which means they will work with any network protocol, essentially acting as a pseudo-A record for an address that is only functional within the Pangolin environment.
