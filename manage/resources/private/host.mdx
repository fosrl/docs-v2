### What about overlaps?

Pangolin smooths away overlapping networks and arbitrarily chooses a single site to resolve the IP address or range to. This is because we want connection requests to any Resource to be as simple as possible for the end users: when they connect to a particular IP address or FQDN, Pangolin figures out which site to send it to and the end user never needs to figure this out.

It is recommended that you create overlapping resources only if absolutely required. If you do, use [Aliases](/manage/resources/private/alias) to explicitly defined which host should be used for a given FQDN or IP address and use the alias to connect.
