When a client connects into an organization they will **NOT** have access to any Resources by default. Access must be explicitly granted to users, roles, or machines for a WireGuard tunnel to be established to the site hosting the Resource. The Client will show no peers unless access is granted.

Access can be granted in several ways:

* **Roles:** Assign access to Resources to specific roles. Any user or machine with that role will gain access to the Resource when they connect.
* **Users:** Assign access to Resources to specific users. Only those users will gain access to the Resource when they connect.
* **Machines:** Assign access to Resources to specific machines. Only those machines will gain access to the Resource when they connect. Note that machines can not be put into roles.

When removing access to a resource, the client will automatically tear down the WireGuard tunnel to that Resource if there are no other Resources accessible on that site.
