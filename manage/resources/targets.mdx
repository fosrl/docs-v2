description: "Configure destination endpoints for resource routing and load balancing"
---

## Overview

When you create a resource in Pangolin, you define different targets that specify where traffic should be routed within your network. Each target represents a specific destination that the resource can proxy to when handling incoming requests.

<Note>
Targets are created on the Newt tunnel, enabling traffic to reach destinations on the remote network without requiring additional routing configuration.
</Note>

## How Targets Work

### Target Routing

Targets function as destination endpoints for your resources:

1. **Resource Creation**: When you create a resource, you configure one or more targets
2. **Traffic Routing**: Incoming traffic is routed to the appropriate target based on your configuration
3. **Network Access**: Newt proxy routes traffic to the local network through the tunnel
4. **Direct Connection**: No additional routing is necessary on the remote network

## Multi-Site Targets (v1.9.0+)

With the introduction of update 1.9.0, targets now have sites associated with them. This enhancement provides significant benefits for reliability and load distribution.

### Site-Distributed Resources

You can now configure targets across different sites for the same resource:

<Card title="High Availability">
  Distribute your resources across multiple sites so that if one site goes down, traffic automatically continues to be served from other available sites.
</Card>

<Card title="Load Balancing">
  Set up load balancing across sites to distribute traffic in a round-robin fashion between all available targets.
</Card>

### Load Balancing Requirements

<Warning>
Load balancing between different targets only works when sites are connected to the same node. In managed Pangolin instances with multiple nodes, ensure load balancing occurs on the same node.
</Warning>

To ensure effective load balancing in multi-node environments:

```bash
newt --prefer-endpoint <specific-endpoint> <other-args>
```

<Note>
Pangolin currently does not load balance between nodes, only between targets on the same node.
</Note>

## Configuring Targets

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Resources">
  In the Pangolin dashboard, go to the **Resources** section.
</Step>

<Step title="Create or Edit Resource">
  Either create a new resource or select an existing resource to edit.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Target">
  Click **Add Target** to configure a new destination.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Target Details">
  Specify the target configuration:
  - **Address**: IP address or hostname of the target service
  - **Port**: Port number where the service is listening
  - **Site**: Select the site where this target is located
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Pangolin uses round-robin load balancing by default, distributing traffic evenly across all targets.
