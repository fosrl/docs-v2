Domains allow you to access your Pangolin resources through custom URLs. Pangolin supports different domain types depending on your deployment model and requirements.

## Getting Started

In Pangolin Cloud, a domain is not required. You can use our provided domain endings like `.hostlocal.app` or `.tunneled.to` for your resources.

## Domain Types

### Wildcard (A Records)

<Tip>This is the most common type used for Self-Hosted</Tip>

Wildcard domains allow you to use any subdomain under a specified base domain or the domain itself. 

- **Exact or Subdomains**: Both the base domain and any subdomains work (e.g., `example.com`, `app.example.com`, `db.example.com`)
- **A Records**: Uses A records pointing to Pangolin's IP addresses
- **Simple**: Just pointed to the IP of your server 

More about self-hosted DNS and networking can be found in the [DNS & Networking Section](/self-host/dns-and-networking).

### Domain Delegation (NS Records)

<Note>Cloud & Enterprise Only</Note>

Gives Pangolin full DNS control over your domain.

Domain delegation is ideal when you want Pangolin to manage your entire domain and all its subdomains.

- **Full Domain Control**: Includes the base domain and all subdomains
- **NS Records**: Uses nameserver delegation for complete DNS management
- **Automatic Subdomains**: All subdomains work automatically

### Single Domain (CNAME Records)

<Note>Cloud & Enterprise Only</Note>

Single domain is limited to the exact domain you specify.

CNAME domains are useful when your domain is already controlled by another provider but you still want to expose resources via Pangolin.

- **Exact Domain Only**: Only the specific domain provided works
- **CNAME Records**: Uses CNAME records pointing to Pangolin
- **No Subdomains**: Subdomains will not work with CNAME domains
- **External DNS**: Your domain remains controlled by your existing DNS provider

## DNS Configuration

### For Wildcard Domains

When using wildcard domains, you'll need to add the following DNS records:

**Example Wildcard Records:**

```dns
Record 1:
Type: A
Name: *.example.com
Value: 192.0.2.1

Record 2:
Type: A
Name: example.com
Value: 192.0.2.1
```

You then access your resources via subdomains like `app.example.com` or `db.example.com` or `example.com`.

### For Domain Delegation

When using domain delegation, you'll need to update your domain's nameservers:

**Example NS Records:**
```dns
Type: NS
Name: test.example.com
Value: ns1.pangolin.net
       ns2.pangolin.net
       ns3.pangolin.net
```

### For Single Domain (CNAME)

When using CNAME domains, you'll need to add CNAME records:

**Example CNAME Records:**
```dns
Record 1:
Type: CNAME
Name: test.example.com
Value: 0nbn5rpcq4wthq6.cname.pangolin.net

Record 2:
Type: CNAME
Name: _acme-challenge.test.example.com
Value: _acme-challenge.0nbn5rpcq4wthq6.cname.pangolin.net
```

<Check>
Once DNS is properly configured and propagated, your domain will be verified and ready to use with your Pangolin resources.
