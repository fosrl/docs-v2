Domains allow you to access your Pangolin resources through custom URLs. Pangolin supports different domain types depending on your deployment model and requirements.

## Getting Started

In Pangolin Cloud, a domain is not required. You can use our provided domain endings like `.hostlocal.app` or `.tunneled.to` for your resources.

## Domain Types

<Info>
SSL certificates are automatically acquired and managed for both CNAME and NS domain types. No additional certificate configuration is required.
</Info>

### Domain Delegation (NS Records)

Domain delegation gives Pangolin full DNS control over your domain:

- **Full Domain Control**: Includes the base domain and all subdomains
- **NS Records**: Uses nameserver delegation for complete DNS management
- **Automatic Subdomains**: All subdomains work automatically

<Tip>
Domain delegation is ideal when you want Pangolin to manage your entire domain and all its subdomains.
</Tip>

### Single Domain (CNAME Records)

Single domain is limited to the exact domain you specify:

- **Exact Domain Only**: Only the specific domain provided works
- **CNAME Records**: Uses CNAME records pointing to Pangolin
- **No Subdomains**: Subdomains will not work with CNAME domains
- **External DNS**: Your domain remains controlled by your existing DNS provider

<Tip>
CNAME domains are useful when your domain is already controlled by another provider but you still want to expose resources via Pangolin.
</Tip>

## Adding Domains

### Pangolin Cloud

Domains can be added to an organization via the domains section of the organization settings:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Organization Settings">
  Go to your organization settings and select the "Domains" section.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Domain Type">
  Select either "Domain Delegation" or "Single Domain" based on your needs.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Domain">
  Provide your domain name (e.g., example.com).
</Step>

<Step title="Configure DNS Records">
  Follow the provided instructions to add the required DNS records to your provider.
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for Verification">
  DNS changes may take time to propagate. The domain will show as verified once propagation is complete.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Domain delegation and CNAME domains are only available in Pangolin Cloud. Community Edition Pangolin uses different domain configuration methods.
</Warning>

### Self-Hosted Pangolin

For self-hosted Pangolin, domains are configured differently, though you can still create domains in the UI.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="System-Wide Domains" icon="gear" href="/self-host/advanced/config-file#domain-configuration">
  Configure domains via the config file, including certificate resolver settings.
</Card>

<Card title="Wildcard Domains" icon="asterisk" href="/self-host/advanced/wild-card-domains">
  Set up wildcard domains for flexible subdomain management.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
In self-hosted Pangolin, domains do not need individual verification, but you're responsible for ensuring correct DNS records point to your server.
</Info>

## DNS Configuration

### For Domain Delegation

When using domain delegation, you'll need to update your domain's nameservers:

**Example NS Records:**
```dns
Type: NS
Name: test.example.com
Value: ns-east.fossorial.io
Value: ns-west.fossorial.io
Value: ns-central.fossorial.io
```

### For Single Domain (CNAME)

When using CNAME domains, you'll need to add CNAME records:

**Example CNAME Records:**
```dns
Record 1:
Type: CNAME
Name: test.example.com
Value: 0nbn5rpcq4wthq6.cname.fossorial.io

Record 2:
Type: CNAME
Name: _acme-challenge.test.example.com
Value: _acme-challenge.0nbn5rpcq4wthq6.cname.fossorial.io
```

<Check>
Once DNS is properly configured and propagated, your domain will be verified and ready to use with your Pangolin resources.
