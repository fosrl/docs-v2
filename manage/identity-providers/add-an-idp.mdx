<Note>
Identity providers are only available in Community Edition Pangolin instances.
</Note>

Identity providers let you authenticate Pangolin users using external identity providers. This is useful for organizations that want to use their existing identity provider infrastructure to manage user authentication.

For example, you may have users defined in Authentik, and you want these users to be able to log in to Pangolin using their existing credentials.
