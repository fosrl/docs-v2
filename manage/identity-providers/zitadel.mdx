The following steps will integrate Zitadel with Pangolin SSO using OpenID Connect (OIDC).

## Prerequisites

These instructions assume you have a working Zitadel organization and project setup already.

### Creating an Application in Zitadel

You need to configure an application in Zitadel:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create New Application">
  Open an existing project and in `Applications` click `New`.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Application">
  Set the name to something memorable (eg. Pangolin).
</Step>

<Step title="Set Application Type">
  For `Type of application` choose `Web`.
</Step>

<Step title="Set Authentication Method">
  For `Authentication Method` choose `Code`.
</Step>

<Step title="Leave Redirect URIs Blank">
  Leave `Redirect URIs` blank for now. We'll come back to this once the IdP is created.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
When you click create, you'll be shown the `ClientSecret` and `ClientId`. Make sure to save these somewhere secure - you won't be able to see the Client Secret again.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure Token Settings">
  Click `Token settings` then change `Auth Token Type` to `JWT` and check the `User Info inside ID Token` box finally hit `Save`.
</Step>

<Step title="Note Endpoints">
  Open `URLs` and make note of:
  - `Authorization Endpoint`
  - `Token Endpoint`
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Identity Providers in Pangolin

In Pangolin, go to “Identity Providers” and click “Add Indentity Provider”. Select the OAuth2/OIDC provider option.

"Name" should be set to something memorable (eg. Zitadel). The "Provider Type" should be set to the default `OAuth2/OIDC`.

### OAuth2/OIDC Configuration (Provider Credentials and Endpoints)

In the OAuth2/OIDC Configuration, you'll need the following fields:

<ResponseField name="Client ID" type="string" required>
  The Client ID from your Zitadel application.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Client Secret" type="string" required>
  The Client Secret from your Zitadel application.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Authorization URL" type="string" required>
  Use the `Authorization Endpoint` from your Zitadel application.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Token URL" type="string" required>
  Use the `Token Endpoint` from your Zitadel application.
</ResponseField>

## Token Configuration

You should leave all of the paths default. In the "Scopes" field, add `openid profile email`.

<Note>
Set the "Identifier Path" to `preferred_username` for Zitadel integration.
</Note>

When you're done, click "Create Identity Provider"! Then, copy the Redirect URL in the "General" tab as you will now need this for your **Zitadel application**.

## Returning to Zitadel

Lastly, you need to edit your `Redirect Settings` in your Zitadel application. Add the URL you copied to the `Redirect URIs`, then hit the `+` button and finally `Save`. Your configuration should now be complete. You'll now need to add an external user] to Pangolin, or if you have "Auto Provision Users" enabled, you can now log in using Zitadel SSO.
