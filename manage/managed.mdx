description: "Learn about Pangolin's managed deployment mode"
---

In this deployment modality you can host your own points of presence with cloud coordination and automatic failover. Data always transits your servers and the cloud handles orchestration between all of your PoPs.

Its essentially just the normal self hosted pangolin setup, but with added benefits of cloud integration and coordinated failover.

<Tip>
    You can deploy a managed Pangolin PoP in seconds [using the installer](../self-host/quick-install-managed). 
</Tip>

### How It Works

- **You Host the PoP**: Manage the infrastructure for your points of presence, which connect your Newt tunnels.
- **We Handle the Rest**: Pangolin Cloud manages the control plane, DNS, certificate management, database, and backups.
- **Failover Made Simple**: Host multiple PoPs with automatic failover between them. Optionally, if your PoPs are unavailable, traffic automatically fails over to our cloud PoPs.

</Note>

### Benefits

- **Data Control**: Traffic flows through your servers, giving you control over data transit costs, privacy, and works with your security policies.
- **High Availability**: Eliminates the complexity of managing high availability while still owning your own infrastructure.
- **Less Management Overhead**: While we update the cloud with new features you don't need to touch your PoPs unless you want to.

<Tip>
Managed deployment is ideal for organizations that need high availability while maintaining control over their infrastructure and data transit.
