## How It Works

For detailed information about how points of presence work and their advantages, see our [Points of Presence](/manage/points-of-presence) documentation.

## Hybrid Deployment

The hybrid model allows you to host your own points of presence while leveraging Pangolin Cloud's coordination and failover capabilities:

### How It Works

- **You Host the Exit Node**: Manage the infrastructure for your points of presence, which connect your Newt tunnels.
- **We Handle the Rest**: Pangolin Cloud manages the control plane, DNS, certificate management, database, and backups.
- **Failover Made Simple**: Host multiple exit nodes with automatic failover between them. Optionally, if your nodes are unavailable, traffic automatically fails over to our cloud nodes.

### Benefits

- **Data Control**: Traffic flows through your servers, giving you control over data transit costs, privacy, and works with your security policies.
- **High Availability**: Eliminates the complexity of managing high availability while still owning your own infrastrcture.

<Tip>
Hybrid deployment is ideal for organizations that need high availability while maintaining control over their infrastructure and data transit.
