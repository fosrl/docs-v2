Pangolin provides secure, application-specific ingress to your applications through a network of points of presence. Users connect to the closest point of presence, which authenticates them and routes their requests through secure tunnels to your applications.

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="User enters through point of presence">
  DNS automatically routes users to the closest available regional point of presence (PoP). A PoP is always available because the control plane fails over between PoPs.
</Step>

<Step title="Authentication and authorization">
  The point of presence verifies the user's identity, checks access permissions, and applies context aware rules such as IP and path based filters, geoblocking, and rate limiting.
</Step>

<Step title="Secure tunnel routing">
  Authenticated requests are routed and flow through encrypted WireGuard tunnels to your applications with optional load balancing and failover for your backend servers.
</Step>

<Step title="Application delivery">
  Your applications receive the requests and respond through the same secure path.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Points of presence provide a mesh of high availability - if one location goes down, traffic automatically routes to the next closest location.
