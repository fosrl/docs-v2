Pangolin provides secure, application-specific ingress to your applications through a network of nodes. Users connect to the closest node, which authenticates them and routes their requests through secure tunnels to your backend.

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="User enters through node">
  DNS automatically routes users to the closest available regional node. A node is always available because the control plane fails over between nodes.
</Step>

<Step title="Authentication and authorization">
  The node verifies the user's identity, checks access permissions, and applies context aware rules such as IP and path based filters, geoblocking, and rate limiting.
</Step>

<Step title="Secure tunnel routing">
  Authenticated requests are routed and flow through encrypted WireGuard tunnels to your applications with optional load balancing and failover for your backend servers.
</Step>

<Step title="Application delivery">
  Your applications receive the requests and respond through the same secure path.
</Step>
</Steps>
