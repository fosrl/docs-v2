## Basic Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Link remote network via sites">
  Join remote networks together using site connectors. Pangolin's lightweight connectors use intelligent routing and NAT traversal to make any network anywhere available.
</Step>

<Step title="Define resources">
  Create resources that represent services or entire network ranges available for remote access. Resources can be public or fully private.
</Step>

<Step title="Users access resources">
  Authenticated users can access resources anywhere using a web browser or when connected with a Pangolin client on their device.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Concepts

Pangolin relies on several components that work together to provide secure remote access. Each component has a specific role in ensuring that only authenticated users can access the resources they are authorized to use.

### Pangolin Server

The Pangolin server is the central coordination component for your network. It stores configuration changes, manages access policies, and coordinates connections between clients and sites. The server handles user authentication and generates access control lists that determine what resources each user can reach.

You can use Pangolin Cloud, which is fully managed, or you can self-host your own Pangolin server for complete control over your infrastructure and data.

### Sites

Sites connect remote networks to your Pangolin server. They use Newt connectors to create secure tunnels from remote networks back to Pangolin. Sites let you expose resources on those networks to authorized users.

Sites run behind firewalls on remote networks. They maintain outbound connections to the Pangolin server. By default, sites block all traffic until you define resources and grant access. This ensures that just deploying a site does not expose any network resources.

The Newt connector handles tunnel creation, NAT traversal, and routing. It makes remote networks available without requiring complex firewall rules or public IP addresses.

### Resources

Resources are the applications, hosts, or network ranges you make available to users. They exist on sites and represent what users can access. Users connect to resources, not to sites directly.

There are two types of resources. Public resources work through web browsers and act as reverse proxies to backend services. Private resources require a client connection and function like a zero-trust VPN.

You must define resources and assign access before users can reach them. By default, no resources are available on sites. This ensures that only explicitly defined resources can be accessed.

### Clients

Clients are software components installed on user devices or machines. They let users and automated systems connect to your Pangolin network and access private resources through a secure tunnel.

Users authenticate through the client using their accounts. Machines connect with credentials. Once connected, users can reach all resources their account has access to. The client handles routing decisions and establishes encrypted tunnels to the appropriate sites.

Clients are available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. They work transparently with applications, so no application configuration is required.

### Remote Nodes

Remote nodes are self-hosted Pangolin servers that you control while using Pangolin Cloud for management and coordination. You maintain complete control over your infrastructure and data flow, while the cloud handles the control plane, DNS, certificate management, and backups.

You can deploy multiple remote nodes for high availability and automatic failover. If your nodes become unavailable, traffic can optionally fail over to cloud infrastructure until you restore service.
