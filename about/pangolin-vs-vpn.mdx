title: "Pangolin vs. VPN"
---

Pangolin and VPNs both provide secure remote access, but they differ in functionality and use cases. VPNs grant full network-level access, requiring client-side software to connect, while Pangolin provides application-specific access directly through a web browser with authentication, eliminating the need for additional software on the userâ€™s device.

## Key Differences

### Access Scope

  - **Pangolin**: Exposes specific applications or services securely. Users access resources via a browser, ensuring no full network access is granted.
  - **VPN**: Provides unrestricted access to the entire private network, which can increase security risks if a device is compromised.

### Access Control

  - **Pangolin**: Enforces zero-trust policies with role-based access control (RBAC), path-based rules, and authentication methods like SSO, OIDC, and 2FA.
  - **VPN**: Relies on network segmentation or ACLs for security, with fewer granular controls.

### Deployment

  - **Pangolin**: Operates as a centralized reverse proxy using encrypted WireGuard tunnels, requiring no public IPs or open ports on edge networks.
  - **VPN**: Requires a VPN server, public IPs, and open ports for inbound connections.

# Pangolin vs. Mesh VPN (e.g., Tailscale, Netbird)

Pangolin and mesh VPNs like Tailscale or Netbird both provide secure remote access, but they differ in their approach and functionality. Mesh VPNs focus on creating peer-to-peer connections between devices for full network access, while Pangolin is designed to expose specific applications or services securely through points of presence, with no need for client-side software on user devices.

Pangolin is a better choice for application-specific access with zero-trust security and no client-side software requirements. Mesh VPNs like Tailscale or Netbird are more suitable for full network access and peer-to-peer connectivity. For environments prioritizing granular access control and simplicity, Pangolin offers a more focused and secure solution.
