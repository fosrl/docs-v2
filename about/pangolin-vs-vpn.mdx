Pangolin and VPNs serve different purposes: Pangolin focuses on secure ingress and application routing, while VPNs provide remote access to internal networks. They offer different approaches to secure connectivity.

## Traditional VPN Limitations

## Pangolin's Ingress-First Approach

Pangolin provides secure, application-specific ingress and routing without the limitations of traditional VPNs:

### Zero-Trust Access Control

## Key Differences

| Feature | Traditional VPN | Pangolin |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Access Scope** | Full network access | Application-specific access |
| **Client Software** | Required | Not needed (browser-based) |
| **Network Requirements** | Public IP, open ports | No public IP needed |
| **Access Control** | Network-level | Zero-trust, granular |
| **Authentication** | Basic credentials | Multi-factor, SSO, OIDC |
| **Infrastructure** | Single server | Distributed points of presence |
| **Security Model** | Network-based trust | Identity-based trust |

# Pangolin vs. Mesh VPN (e.g., Tailscale, Netbird)

Pangolin and mesh VPNs like Tailscale or Netbird both provide secure remote access, but they differ in their approach and functionality. Mesh VPNs focus on creating peer-to-peer connections between devices for full network access, while Pangolin is designed to expose specific applications or services securely through points of presence, with no need for client-side software on user devices.

Pangolin is a better choice for application-specific access with zero-trust security and no client-side software requirements. Mesh VPNs like Tailscale or Netbird are more suitable for full network access and peer-to-peer connectivity. For environments prioritizing granular access control and simplicity, Pangolin offers a more focused and secure solution.
