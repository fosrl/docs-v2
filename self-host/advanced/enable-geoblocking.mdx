To enable geoblocking in Pangolin Community you must download and place the Maxmind geoip database into the `config/` directory and update the config file. This can be done for free.

<Tip>
Remember to keep the GeoIP database updated regularly, as IP-to-country mappings can change over time. You can just repeat the download and extraction steps periodically to ensure your database is current.
</Tip>

You can use the installer to download and place the database for you, just grab the latest installer:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://digpangolin.com/get-installer.sh | bash
  ```
Then run the installer again:

  ```bash
  ./installer
  ```
