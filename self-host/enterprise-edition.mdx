## Edition Comparison

- All core Pangolin features included  

### Enterprise Edition

- Includes all Community Edition features  
- Unlocks "Paid Features" for qualifying users (see below)
- Requires valid license key for activation

## Licensing Overview

The Enterprise Edition is distributed under the **Fossorial Commercial License**, which provides different terms based on your organization's revenue:
