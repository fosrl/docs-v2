## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Linux server** with root access and public IP address
- **Open ports on firewall** for 80 (TCP), 443 (TCP), 51820 (UDP), and 21820 (UDP for clients)

<Tip>
**Recommended**: Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+ for best compatibility and performance.
</Tip>

## Choose Your Server

Need help choosing? See our [complete VPS guide](/self-host/choosing-a-vps) for suggestions.

## DNS & Networking

Before installing Pangolin, ensure you've opened the required port on your firewall. See our guide on [DNS & networking](/self-host/dns-and-networking) for more information.

## Installation Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Download the installer">
  Connect to your server via SSH and download the installer:
  
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://digpangolin.com/get-installer.sh | bash
  ```
  
  The installer supports both AMD64 (x86_64) and ARM64 architectures.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the installer">
  Execute the installer with root privileges:
  
  ```bash 
  sudo ./installer
  ```
  
  The installer places all files in the current directory. Move the installer to your desired installation directory before running it.
</Step>

<Step title="Do you already have credentials from the dashboard?">

If you are on your game and have already generated credentials for this node in the dashboard enter them here.

<Tip>
If you don't have them yet you can just select no when asked and we will create it in a later step.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="The public addressable IP address for this node">

    Enter either the public IP address of your server or a domain name that resolves to it. 

    If you choose to use a domain keep in mind this just resolves your node on the internet while the actual subdomains for resources will be managed in the cloud.

</Step>

<Step title="Generate credentials">

If you did not enter credentials earlier then you should see something like the following: 

```
Your managed credentials have been obtained successfully.
        ID:     he4g78wevj25msf
        Secret: n7sd18twfko0q0vrb7wyclqzbvvnx1fqt7ezv8xewhdb9s7d
```

Go to the [Pangolin dashboard](https://pangolin.fossorial.io/) and log in. Navigate to the "Self-hosted" section and add a new node. Use this ID and secret to register your node.

<Tip>
More than one account can use the same node credentials. This is useful for teams.
</Tip>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Post-Installation Setup

Once installation completes successfully, you'll see:

```
Installation complete!
```

Navigate to the [Pangolin dashboard](https://pangolin.fossorial.io/) and create sites, resources, and targets for your managed node.
