## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Linux server** with root access and public IP address
- **Domain name** pointing to your server's IP address for the dashboard
- **Email address** for Let's Encrypt SSL certificates and admin log in
- **Open ports on firewall** for 80 (TCP), 443 (TCP), 51820 (UDP), and 21820 (UDP for clients)

<Tip>
**Recommended**: Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+ for best compatibility and performance.
</Tip>

## Choose Your Server

Need help choosing? See our [complete VPS guide](/self-host/choosing-a-vps) for suggestions.

## DNS & Networking

Before installing Pangolin, ensure you've set up DNS for your domain(s) and opened the required port on your firewall. See our guide on [DNS & networking](/self-host/dns-and-networking) for more information.

## Installation Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Download the installer">
  Connect to your server via SSH and download the installer:
  
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://pangolin.net/get-installer.sh | bash
  ```
  
  The installer supports both AMD64 (x86_64) and ARM64 architectures.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the installer">
  Execute the installer with root privileges:
  
  ```bash
  sudo ./installer
  ```
  
  The installer places all files in the current directory. Move the installer to your desired installation directory before running it.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure basic settings">
  The installer will prompt you for essential configuration:
  
  - **Base Domain**: Enter your root domain without subdomains (e.g., `example.com`)
  - **Dashboard Domain**: Press Enter to accept the default `pangolin.example.com` or enter a custom domain
  - **Let's Encrypt Email**: Provide an email for SSL certificates and admin login
  - **Tunneling**: Choose whether to install Gerbil for tunneled connections (default: yes). You can run Pangolin without tunneling. It will function as a standard reverse proxy.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure email (optional)">
  <Tip>
    Email functionality is optional and can be added later.
  </Tip>

  Choose whether to enable SMTP email functionality:
  
  - **Default**: No (recommended for initial setup)
  - **If enabled**: You'll need SMTP server details (host, port, username, password)
  
</Step>

<Step title="Start installation">
  Confirm that you want to install and start the containers:
  
  - The installer will pull Docker images (pangolin, gerbil, traefik)
  - Containers will be started automatically
  - This process takes 2-3 minutes depending on your internet connection
  
  You'll see progress indicators as each container is pulled and started.
</Step>

<Step title="Install CrowdSec (optional)">
  The installer will ask if you want to install CrowdSec for additional security:
  
  - **Default**: No (recommended for initial setup)
  - **If enabled**: You'll need to confirm you're willing to manage CrowdSec configuration
  
  <Warning>
  CrowdSec adds complexity and requires manual configuration for optimal security. Only enable if you're comfortable managing it.
  </Warning>
  
  <Info>
  CrowdSec can be installed later if needed. The basic installation provides sufficient security for most use cases.
  </Info>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Post-Installation Setup

Once installation completes successfully, you'll see:

```
Installation complete!

To complete the initial setup, please visit:
https://pangolin.example.com/auth/initial-setup
```

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the dashboard">
  Navigate to the URL shown in the installer output:
  
  ```
  https://<your-dashboard-domain>/auth/initial-setup
  ```
  
  <Check>
  The dashboard should load with SSL certificate automatically configured. It might take a few minutes for the first cert to validate, so don't worry if the browser throws an insecure warning.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Create admin account">
  Complete the initial admin user setup:
  
  - Enter your admin email address
  - Set a strong password
  - Verify your email (if email is configured)
  
  <Warning>
  Use a strong, unique password for your admin account. This account has full system access.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Create your first organization">
  After logging in:
  
  1. Click "Create Organization"
  2. Enter organization name and description
  
  <Check>
  You're now ready to start adding applications and configuring your reverse proxy!
  </Check>
</Step>
