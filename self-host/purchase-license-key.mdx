## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I reset my host and can’t re-register my key. What do I do?">
  A license is tied to one host (by host ID) at a time. If you reset your instance and need to use the same key on a new host, contact us at [support@pangolin.net](mailto:support@pangolin.net) and we’ll reset it for you.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I cancel my subscription?">
  Open the **Billing** page in the dashboard and click **Modify License Subscription**. You’ll be taken to the Stripe billing page where you can manage or cancel your subscription. If you run into any issues, email us.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I try Enterprise before buying?">
  We don’t offer a formal trial, but you can evaluate Pangolin using the free Community edition. If you’d like a demo or have questions, email us and we can walk you through it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I pay monthly instead of yearly?">
  Licenses are sold as annual subscriptions. If you’d rather pay in 12 monthly installments instead of one yearly payment, contact us and we can see what we can do.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I need more than 50 users and 50 sites. What are my options?">
  That’s outside the self-serve license limits. Contact us for a custom quote.
