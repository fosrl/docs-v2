This is a community guide and is not officially supported. If you have any issues, please reach out to the [author](https://github.com/Lokowitz).
</Note>

This is a basic example of collecting metrics from Traefik and CrowdSec using Prometheus and visualizing them with Grafana dashboards.

<Warning>
Important for users with low-powered server (1GB RAM):
This setup will increase the use of your server RAM.
</Warning>

## Configuration

### Traefik

For claiming metrics from Traefik we have to adjust some configuration files.

1. Udpate the `docker-compose.yml` file of the Pangolin stack to expose metrics port `8082` for the Prometheus connection:

```yaml
service:
  gerbil:
    ports:
      - 8082:8082
```

<Warning>
Docker’s NAT-based port publishing feature automatically exposes all `ports:` defined in `docker-compose` file. This behavior can bypass your host firewall settings, potentially exposing services that you did not intend to make public.
Please see [complete warning about exposing ports](/Getting%20Started/dns-networking#ports-to-expose).
</Warning>

2. Update the `/config/traefik/traefik_config.yml` file to include the following:

```yaml
entryPoints:
  metrics:
    address: ":8082"

metrics:
  prometheus:
    buckets:
      - 0.1
      - 0.3
      - 1.2
      - 5.0
    entryPoint: metrics
    addEntryPointsLabels: true
    addRoutersLabels: true
    addServicesLabels: true
```

3. Restart the Gerbil and Traefik container to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo docker restart traefik gerbil
```

### Crowdsec

For claiming metrics from Crowdsec we have to adjust the docker compose files.

1. Udpate the `docker-compose.yml` file of the Pangolin stack to expose metrics port `6060` for the Prometheus connection:

```yaml
service:
  crowdsec:
    ports:
      - 6060:6060
```

<Warning>
Docker’s NAT-based port publishing feature automatically exposes all `ports:` defined in the `docker-compose` file on all network interfaces. This behavior can bypass your host firewall settings, potentially exposing services that you did not intend to make public.
Please see [complete warning about exposing ports](/Getting%20Started/dns-networking#ports-to-expose).
</Warning>


2. Restart the Crowdsec container to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo docker restart crowdsec
```

## Prometheus

1. Create a new Prometheus container or add it to `docker-compose.yml` of Pangolin stack:

```yaml
services:
  prometheus:
    container_name: prometheus
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 9090:9090
    volumes:
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - ./config/prometheus/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
      - ./config/prometheus/data:/prometheus
```

<Warning>
Docker’s NAT-based port publishing feature automatically exposes all `ports:` defined in the `docker-compose` file on all network interfaces. This behavior can bypass your host firewall settings, potentially exposing services that you did not intend to make public.
Please see [complete warning about exposing ports](/Getting%20Started/dns-networking#ports-to-expose).
</Warning>


2. Create a `prometheus.yml` file in the `/config/prometheus` directory with the following content:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]

  - job_name: traefik
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["172.17.0.1:8082"]

  - job_name: crowdsec
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["172.17.0.1:6060"]
```

3. Create a folder `data` in `/config/prometheus` and change the ower and owning group:

```bash
chown nobody:nogroup data
```

4. Start the Prometheus container:

```bash
sudo docker conpose up -d
```

## Grafana

1. Create a new Grafana container or add it to `docker-compose.yml` of Pangolin stack:

```yaml
services:
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    container_name: grafana
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - ./config/grafana/data:/var/lib/grafana
```

<Warning>

Please see [complete warning about exposing ports](/Getting%20Started/dns-networking#ports-to-expose).
</Warning>

2. Start the Grafana container:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

<Note>
Default login credentials for Grafana admin user is admin:admin.
</Note>

### Add Prometheus Connection

Add the Prometheus connection under Connections -> Add new connection.

Set `http://172.17.0.1:9090` as `Prometheus Server URL` and click `Save & test`.

### Add Dashboard

Add a Dashboard under Dashboard -> New -> Import and import a pre configured Dashboard or create your own.
