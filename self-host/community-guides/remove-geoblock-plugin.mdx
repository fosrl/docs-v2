Pangolin now supports native geoblocking. If you previously installed the Traefik GeoBlock plugin, remove it before enabling native geoblocking to avoid duplicate blocking or startup errors.

## Remove the GeoBlock plugin

<Steps>
<Step title="Remove GeoBlock middleware references">
  Remove any references to `geoblock@file` from your Traefik entry points, routers, or labels.

  Example removal in `/config/traefik/traefik_config.yml`:

  ```yaml
  entryPoints:
    websecure:
      http:
        middlewares:
          # Remove this line
          - geoblock@file
  ```
</Step>
<Step title="Remove the plugin definition from Traefik static config">
  Delete the GeoBlock plugin block from `/config/traefik/traefik_config.yml`:

  ```yaml
  experimental:
    plugins:
      geoblock:
        moduleName: github.com/PascalMinder/geoblock
        version: v0.3.2
  ```
</Step>
<Step title="Remove the middleware configuration from dynamic config">
  Delete the GeoBlock middleware section from `/config/traefik/dynamic_config.yml`:

  ```yaml
  http:
    middlewares:
      geoblock:
        plugin:
          geoblock:
            ...
  ```
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Traefik">
  Restart Traefik to apply the changes:

  ```bash
  docker restart traefik
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>
