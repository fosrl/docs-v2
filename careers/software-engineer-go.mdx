## About Pangolin

Pangolin delivers identity-aware remote access to internal apps and services, starting with secure reverse tunneling, and is evolving toward broader zero‑trust networking.

We build in the open and are self‑hosted by default so teams retain control over data and infrastructure. The system is policy‑driven, integrates with standard IdPs, exposes clear observability and health, and provides an API for automation.

If you're interested in open-source auth and networking infrastructure, we'd love to chat.

## About The Role

As a Go Network Software Engineer at Pangolin, you'll help architect, build, and maintain the core of the Pangolin system. You'll work primarily on Newt, Gerbil, and Olm tunneling components and the central server APIs. As an early hire, you'll play a foundational role in shaping how Pangolin is built as both a product and a company.

- Work to develop a hub and spoke, hole punched, zero-trust VPN solution and desktop applications
- Troubleshooting and resolving complex issues related to distributed systems, networking, and security.
- Actively engaging with the open-source community, providing support, and driving engagement on platforms like GitHub and Discord
- Ship quickly and get instant feedback from our large open-source user-base

### Other Technical Qualifcations
