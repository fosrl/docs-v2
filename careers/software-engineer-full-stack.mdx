## About Pangolin

Pangolin delivers identity-aware remote access to internal apps and services. Our platform replaces legacy VPNs and simplifies secure access to infrastructure, applications, and developer environments.

We build in the open and are self‑hosted by default so teams retain control over data and infrastructure. The system is policy‑driven, integrates with standard IdPs, exposes clear observability and health, and provides an API for automation.

If you're interested in open-source auth and networking infrastructure, we'd love to chat.

## About The Role

As a Full Stack Software Engineer at Pangolin, you'll help architect, build, and maintain the core of the Pangolin system. You'll work primarily on the Pangolin container, the central server with the UI, APIs, schemas, and more. As an early hire, you'll play a foundational role in shaping how Pangolin is built as both a product and a company.

  - Frontend (NextJS, Tailwind, ShadCN)
  - Backend (Express APIs, SQL, Drizzle ORM)
  - Processes (CICD, Internal Tooling)
- Troubleshooting and resolving complex issues related to distributed systems, networking, and security.
- Actively engaging with the open-source community, providing support, and driving engagement on platforms like GitHub and Discord
