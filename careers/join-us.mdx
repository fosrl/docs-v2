## About Pangolin

Pangolin delivers identity-aware remote access to internal apps and services. Our platform replaces legacy VPNs and simplifies secure access to infrastructure, applications, and developer environments.

We build in the open and are self‑hosted by default so teams retain control over data and infrastructure. The system is policy‑driven, integrates with standard IdPs, exposes clear observability and health, and provides an API for automation.

If you're interested in open-source auth and networking infrastructure, we'd love to chat.
