## About Pangolin

Pangolin delivers identity-aware remote access to internal apps and services, starting with secure reverse tunneling, and is evolving toward broader zero‑trust networking.

We build in the open and are self‑hosted by default so teams retain control over data and infrastructure. The system is policy‑driven, integrates with standard IdPs, exposes clear observability and health, and provides an API for automation.

If you're interested in open-source auth and networking infrastructure, we'd love to chat.
